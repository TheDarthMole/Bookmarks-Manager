# Acme Corp Bookmark Manager

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Linux
Bundler
Ruby
```

### Installing

First of all we need to make sure all of the dependencies are installed, to do this run bundler

Bundler installs all the ruby gems that are required

```
bundle install
```

Once this has completed, you should have the required gems to start the server
To start the server, enter the following command:

```
ruby startServer.rb
```

This should start the server up on `port 4567`. If you are hosting this on codio.io you can access it by using your unique url where word1 and word2 are your unique words: `https://word1-word2-4567.codio.io/`

In order to login to the website, you can either make your own account (As a standard user) or you could try logging into one of the admin accounts with the username and password:

`Email: admin@acmecorp.com`
`Password: Password1!`

This should give you access to the whole website as an admin.
